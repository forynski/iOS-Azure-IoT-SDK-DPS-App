This sample uses the [Azure SDK for C](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c) wrapped as a Swift library. The Swift library can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-sdk-for-c-swift). It allows users to choose the MQTT library of their choice and offers APIs which helps make Azure IoT concepts easier.
